# splitcalculator

splitcalculator is a widget for Open Broadcaster Software (OBS) for the Steam release of the game Halo: The Master Chief Collection. The widget is a timer for speedrunning any of the campaigns, and automatically pauses during loading screens in between each level. This removes the need for the speedrunner to manually pause and start the timer again during loading screens.
